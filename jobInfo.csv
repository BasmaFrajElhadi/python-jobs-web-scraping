You have previous experience with  teaching kids (ages 7 - 14), and are quite comfortable managing a class of kids as young as 7 years old.
 You measure success at teaching by how engaged the learners are, how much fun they're having, and how well they understood and grasped the concepts being taught, rather  than how much of the syllabus was covered in a class (we have kids asking us for classes lasting longer cos they love them, and some even say that they'd like to come to their CodeTreps classes instead of school, and this is the kind of experience we expect to be delivered to our young learners).
 You have background in Coding/Computer Science  (even through self study, freelance work, or any courses taken).
 You are comfortable with public speaking and presenting to crowds (maybe even enjoy it) both in  Arabic and English
 Very good spoken English.
 You will even be a greater fit if you (optional):
Have some professional experience with coding (even through freelance work or internships)
Have a reasonable background in entrepreneurship concepts.
Have background in any of the following: Scratch, Pictoblocks, Code.org, Python, JavaScript, App Inventor, IoT, or Electronic Circuits.
Enrolled or worked with kids on coding competitions.
What we offer:
A chance to teach foundational essential skills to kids, and set them up for building great things  in the future, in a healthy environment where you will be able to be  yourself and have fun while doing it! Who knows? Maybe what you teach will inspire you to build the next big thing!
 A dream that you will grow with across the Middle East, or even the World!
 A culture that encourages and helps with growth and personal development.
 A location in the heart of Alexandria, 10 minutes walk from the heart of Downtown.
 A competitive salary that grows as we grow together
 You'll be a member of our founding team, aimed to lead and help create the regional team that will establish a future vision that spans across the MENA region."
